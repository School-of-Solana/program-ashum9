# Synelar: The Internet Layer for Digital Identity

**One Identity. Infinite Ownership. Instant Earnings.**

Tired of apps stealing your data while you rebuild profiles endlessly? Synelar fixes that—turning login into a revenue stream. Your wallet. Your rules. Your wallet fattens.

## TL;DR: Login That Pays
No native ID on the web means chaos: data theft, repetition, zero user profit. Synelar's protocol delivers:
- **Wallet login**: Password-free, secure.
- **MetaID NFT**: Soulbound on-chain passport.
- **Encrypted profile**: Off-chain, user-controlled.
- **Portable rep**: Carry your cred everywhere.
- **X402 micropayments**: Apps pay *you* per access.
- **Solana-powered**: 65K TPS, <$0.00025 fees.

From victim to VIP: Own your digital self.

## The Problem: Web2's Identity Trap
- **Centralized Giants** (Google, Meta): Harvest your data, ban you on a whim. No portability, no earnings.
- **User Pain**: Endless forms, siloed reps, devs waste time on auth.
- **Scale**: $200B market—you get zilch.

It's broken. Synelar breaks the cycle.

## The Fix: Synelar Protocol
Your **MetaID**: On-chain NFT + encrypted off-chain vault. Apps rent access via wallet sigs—*you* earn 70% of X402 streams.

**Key Wins**:
- **Privacy-First**: AES encryption, IPFS/Arweave storage.
- **Verifiable Trust**: Optional SAS KYC proofs.
- **Seamless**: Works with Phantom, Solflare; Anchor contracts for speed.

## Why Solana? Built for Blitz
- Blazing TPS for micro-interactions.
- Dev tools: Metaplex NFTs, Lit perms, X402 streams.
- No ETH gas—pure efficiency.
